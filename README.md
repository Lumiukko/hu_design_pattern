# Heads Up Design Pattern in Ruby

-- Currently on hold, as there is no need for me to practice Ruby at this time. --

This repository is for myself practicing Ruby and refreshing design pattern.

I am attempting to implement the design pattern from the book in Ruby.

Any advice is welcome.

Since Ruby is different than Java, the pattern may not be optimal.
